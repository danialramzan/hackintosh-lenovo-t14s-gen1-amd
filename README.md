# hackintosh-lenovo-t14s-gen1-amd

// temporary consolidation of information for this project
- the t14s gen1 and the x13 gen1 share the same mobo, this can be confirmed by searching for schematics on badcaps
- the original source for my efi was a t14 efi, i removed the kext associated with ethernet.
- attempting to use macos sequoia
- MacBookPro16,3 2020


try (in order):
  - replace placeholder values with gensmbios vals ✔️
  - generate custom ssdt/ddst
  - swap out skhynix ssd
  - update kext versions to latest for sequoia
